    "A database is a collection of data that is organized in a way that allows for easy storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information. It serves as a central location for data that is used by applications and systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL databases are two different types of databases that differ in their approach to storing and managing data. SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that store data in tables with predefined schemas. They use SQL to manage and manipulate data, and are well-suited for handling complex queries and transactions. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that store data in a more flexible, unstructured format. They are designed to handle large amounts of data that may be unstructured or semi-structured, and may not have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases are typically more scalable and can handle more complex data structures. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and DynamoDB."
